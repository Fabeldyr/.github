## Our Mission

At Fabeldyr Studios, our mission is to craft engaging stories and gameplay that resonate with players. We aim to push the boundaries of creativity and innovation in our projects.

## Current Project

### Nightguard
**Nightguard** is our current project, a 3D action-adventure game with RPG elements. Players will descend through a perilous dungeon to level up, obtain gold, and collect valuable items. The ultimate goal is to confront the Mad Wizard, Dragon, or Demon who owns the randomly generated dungeon, gaining fortune, renown, or overthrowing the evil that awaits at the bottom.

#### Features
- **Singleplayer Mode**: Explore procedurally generated dungeons, level up your character, and engage in dynamic combat.
- **Elemental Interactions**: Utilize fire, ice, and water to solve puzzles and defeat enemies.
- **Mapping System**: Navigate through signature or random dungeon layouts with an interactive map.
- **Market System**: Trade with NPC vendors to upgrade your gear and purchase supplies.
- **Future Multiplayer Mode**: Cooperative gameplay for an even more immersive experience.
